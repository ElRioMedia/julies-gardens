# julies-gardens
This is a simple HTML and Vanilla CSS Static Site created for my portfolio.

MY NOTES

This was my first full website build I created with HTML and CSS. It's a copy cat website of a Wix build I did for my Mum's landscape gardening business.

What I have done is to revisit this quite some time after learning a lot more about this, and I decided, instead of changing and updating everything so it's perfect, I have deliberately left some things in that are incorrect and highlighted them with comments.

I believe it's just as good to show work and highlight what didn't work, as well as what did.

This website has not been optimised for mobile, so you can see the effect lack of processing has on this when analysing with the chrome dev tools.

Some parts though have been updated quite a bit, including mainly refactoring the CSS as it was a mess! Also some class naming of and restructuring of the HTML so it was less complicated and more logical.


SUMMARY

Great exercise and still learning. I have noted in the comments the main issue that arose with using float in conjunction with fixed CSS background images.

I had originally figured a different solution, but the code was very long winded and not using the box model appropriately.

Here are the main issue I have flagged for this site:

Main Issues:
1 - lack of use and understanding of semantic HTML elements
2 - design colour palette not amazing. Ok, but could do better.
3 - long winded CSS and needs tightening up
4 - images not compressed
5 - images not in a consistent format, some live links, some being linked through the project path, and using 3 different file formats!
6 - questionable use of some wrappers for float solutions in the html.
7 - could do with better use of class naming. I had to separate the sections with big HTML comment lines as no use of semantic HTML sectioning elements, which made it hard to read and understand!
8 - no favicon
9 - not responsive for use with mobile!!!

Overall though, not bad for a first go! Great stuff, keep it going.
